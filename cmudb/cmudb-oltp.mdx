# CMU DB OLTP

### logical schema (erd)

### physical schema (tuple/struct)

### db engine functional components

- storage manager
- query processor
- transaction manager

### storage manager

- provides interface between data storage and app queries
- interacts with the OS file system
- includes auth, transaction, file, buffer
- implements several data structures for the physical implementation including
  - files
  - dictionary
  - indices

### query processor

- ddl interpreter records statements in dictionary
- dml compiler converts sql into a query plan
- query eval engine executes compiler output instructions

### transaction manager

- ensures consistency
- controls concurrency

### architecture

- 2-tier hits db directly
- 3-tier has app calling db

### dba tasks

- schema definition
- storage and access definition
- schema modification
- authorization management
- mx backups disk space upgrade monitoring

### relational algebra

- select
- project
- union
- intersect
- difference
- cartesian product

### sql

- non-aggregated values must appear in group by
- having filters aggregate computation
- redirect output to new table
- order by column number (order by 2)
- offset (skip first n rows)
- window functions

### window functions

- performs a calc across a set of tuples related to current tuple wihtout collapsing them into a single tuple to support running totals, ranks and moving averages
- like an aggregation but tuples are not grouped into a single output tuple

```sql
select func-name(...) over(...) from table-name
```

- func-name is the aggregation or special function
- over is how to slice up data which can also sort tuples

```sql
select *, row_number() over(order by 1) from table-name
```

- special window functions

  - row_number()
  - rank()
  - lag()
  - lead()
  - first_value()
  - last_value()

- over keyword specifies how to group together tuples when computing the function
- partition by to specify group

```sql
select *, row_number() over(partition by col1 order by col2) from table-name
```

- find student with second highest gpa

```sql
select * from (
  select *, rank() over (partition by cid order by grade asc) as rank from enrolled
) as ranking where ranking.rank = 2
```
